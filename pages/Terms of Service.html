            <h2 id="description-of-the-platform">Description of the Platform</h2>
            <p>The Platform is a hosting service. Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (<strong>"Content"</strong>), which will be stored by Sikon at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform and accessible via the Website, Apps and elsewhere. The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Website, Apps or certain Services (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.</p>
            <p>The Platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users to engage with and learn from the Sikon community in order to build a following and ensure you get the content that inerests you most. For example, users who upload content to Sikon will gain access to our creator stats feature, which provides creators with insights into how the content they upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and downloaders of such content.</p>
            <p>Some features of our Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a certain Service (see <a href="#subscriptions-and-gift-codes">Subscriptions and Gift Codes</a> below). Sikon however remains free for users that choose not to subscribe to such Services. In order to make the Platform available for free and provide you with personally relevant features, we serve tailored ads on the Platform on behalf of third party advertisers. To that end, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform to inform the nature of the ads we show you and provide you with a customized experience. More information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is described in our <a href="/pages/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="meetups">Meetups</h2>
            <p>Sikon has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world (<strong>"Meetups"</strong>). While Sikon is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded promotional materials to help organizers promote their Meetups, Sikon does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such Meetups. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely at your own risk and Sikon does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any Sikon users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.</p>

            <p>The Platform includes access to customizable players (<strong>"Players"</strong>), and an embeddable version of the Sikon waveform player (<strong>"Widget"</strong>) for incorporation into usersâ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service. This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.</p>
            <p>You may not, without the prior written consent of Sikon, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part. Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of Sikon, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre. You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that Sikon or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget. The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.</p>
            <p>Sikon reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion.</p>

            <p>Sikon reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only. In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, Sikon shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such decision in advance.</p>

            <p>Sikon may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time. In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription. In all other cases, where Sikon proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, Sikon will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your SikonÂ® account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance. You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the <a href="#termination">Termination</a> section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription.</p>
